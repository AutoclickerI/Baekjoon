### 문제 설명

<p>The N (1 <= N <= 20) cows conveniently numbered 1...N are playing yet another one of their crazy games with Farmer John. The cows will arrange themselves in a line and ask Farmer John what their line number is. In return, Farmer John can give them a line number and the cows must rearrange themselves into that line.</p>

<p>A line number is assigned by numbering all the permutations of the line in lexicographic order.</p>

<p>Consider this example:</p>

<pre>Farmer John has 5 cows and gives them the line number of 3.
The permutations of the line in ascending lexicographic order:
1st: 1 2 3 4 5
2nd: 1 2 3 5 4
3rd: 1 2 4 3 5
Therefore, the cows will line themselves in the cow line 1 2 4 3 5.</pre>

<p>The cows, in return, line themselves in the configuration "1 2 5 3 4" and ask Farmer John what their line number is.</p>

<p>Continuing with the list:</p>

<pre>4th : 1 2 4 5 3
5th : 1 2 5 3 4
Farmer John can see the answer here is 5</pre>

<p>Farmer John and the cows would like your help to play their game. They have K (1 <= K <= 10,000) queries that they need help with. Query i has two parts: C_i will be the command, which is either 'P' or 'Q'.</p>

<p>If C_i is 'P', then the second part of the query will be one integer A_i (1 <= A_i <= N!), which is a line number. This is Farmer John challenging the cows to line up in the correct cow line.</p>

<p>If C_i is 'Q', then the second part of the query will be N distinct integers B_ij (1 <= B_ij <= N). This will denote a cow line. These are the cows challenging Farmer John to find their line number.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K</li>
	<li>Lines 2..2*K+1: Line 2*i and 2*i+1 will contain a single query.</li>
	<li>Line 2*i will contain just one character: 'Q' if the cows are lining up and asking Farmer John for their line number or 'P' if Farmer John gives the cows a line number.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the line 2*i is 'Q', then line 2*i+1 will contain N space-separated integers B_ij which represent the cow line. If the line 2*i is 'P', then line 2*i+1 will contain a single integer A_i which is the line number to solve for.</p>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Lines 1..K: Line i will contain the answer to query i.</li>
</ul>

<p>If line 2*i of the input was 'Q', then this line will contain a single integer, which is the line number of the cow line in line 2*i+1.</p>

<p>If line 2*i of the input was 'P', then this line will contain N space separated integers giving the cow line of the number in line 2*i+1.</p>
